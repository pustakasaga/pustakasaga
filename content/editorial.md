**Peer Review Process**

The SAGA journal will initially ask the Editor-in-Chief to screen the submitted manuscripts. Then, papers will be distributed to the editorial board based on their areas of expertise.

Table Review. These papers will undergo desk review where the paper will be read and screened by members of the editorial board to ensure that the paper meets the guidelines for writing, focus, and scope with excellent academic quality. If it does not meet the requirements, the author will be given the opportunity to revise the manuscript according to the criteria provided. However, there is also the possibility that the manuscript will be rejected immediately.

Peer Review. SAGA journal implements a double blind review policy whereby the reviewer's name is always hidden from the submitting author and vice versa. Manuscripts will be sent to peer-reviewers based on their areas of expertise. Then the editorial board will make a decision on the reviewer's comments or suggestions. The decision includes:

Accepted because it can be published directly Accepted with Small Revision (let the author revise with a certain deadline) Accepted with Major Revision (let the author revise with a certain time limit) Rejected, because it can be re-evaluated after revision.

The article review process usually takes an average of 12 weeks. This review period depends on the duration of the editor and reviewer in reviewing the manuscript.
